## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, Bootstrap, Passport.js

Fullstack application was created to help a coffee shop manage its orders. Cashiers are able to enter a customer's order and send it back to the baristas to start working on it. Baristas are required to create an account in order to view the orders queue. When a barista logs in they'll be presented with a screen showing all the pending orders and orders waiting to be picked up. When a barista completes an order it's sent to the waiting to picked up queue. Once an order has been picked up, a barista can remove the order from the queue.
